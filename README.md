### `[ STATUS: OPERATIONAL ]`

ARKHEION-X is an active project focused on creating robust, self-sufficient systems that operate at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and quantitative analysis. We build tools that are designed to be deployed and left to execute their mission autonomously.

### Active Modules

| Module | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Vektor Sentinel** | `[ v0.6.0 - AUTONOMOUS ]` | Real-time software supply chain threat hunter. |
| üìà **Quant Engine** | `[ v1.1 - PROTOTYPE ]` | Alpha-Intel engine for on-chain & off-chain data. |
| üß† **Athena Engine** | `[ RESEARCH ]` | PsyOps & narrative analysis engine. |

### Module Spotlight: Quant Engine
The Quant Engine is our first step into alpha intelligence. It's a high-resilience Python engine designed to monitor blockchain networks for market-moving events in real-time.

**Current capabilities (v1.1):**
-   Multi-RPC failover for robust connectivity.
-   Tracks significant ETH & ERC20 token transfers on Arbitrum.
-   A unique feature to detect potential "Smart Money" activity by identifying fresh wallets funded by major exchanges.
-   Logs all findings to a local SQLite database for analysis.

### High-Level Roadmap

* **Q3 2025:** Vektor Sentinel achieved full autonomous deployment.
* **Q4 2025:** Develop and integrate Quant Engine MVP, including local persistence and Smart Money detection.
* **Q1 2026:** Begin research and prototyping for Athena Engine.

### Tech Stack
- **Primary Languages:** Node.js, Python
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions
- **Databases:** SQLite (prototyping), PostgreSQL (production target)

### How to Contribute
This project is currently developed by a solo operator. Feedback, bug reports, and suggestions are highly welcome. Please open an "Issue" on this repository.
